# Help-IT-s-Complicated-Investigation

## Objective

To perform a structured cybersecurity investigation by analyzing Windows event logs, identifying suspicious activity, and documenting findings using a clear SOC‑style workflow. This project demonstrates my ability to break down an incident, review relevant artifacts, interpret log data, and communicate results in a professional, repeatable format.

### Skills Learned
- Understanding how to approach an investigation using a SOC workflow
- Identifying key Windows Event Logs relevant to authentication, process creation, and security events
- Reviewing Windows Defender alerts and correlating them with system activity
- Recognizing indicators of suspicious behavior and validating them with log evidence
- Documenting findings clearly using structured reporting (What Happened, How It Was Detected, Impact, Recommendations)
- Mapping activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques at a beginner‑friendly level
- Strengthening analytical thinking and evidence‑based decision making
- Improving familiarity with triage steps: verify, correlate, conclude

### Tools Used
- Windows Event Viewer – log review and event correlation
- Sysmon – process creation, network connection, and system activity visibility
- Windows Defender – alert review and threat detection context
- PowerShell – command‑line awareness and script interpretation
- CyberChef – decoding, parsing, and quick data analysis
- VirusTotal – file and hash reputation checks
- Notepad++ – note‑taking, log parsing, and documentation
- Splunk (Fundamentals) – understanding how SIEM searches and detection logic work
